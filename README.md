# fangameDexTracker
a rewrite of https://pokedextracker.com/ with support for fangames
# Overview
Unlike pokedextracker, this isnt going to save your progress server-side, i just dont have the hosting infrastructure to support that, but! it will let you hit a button to save a json file of your mons to your drive. 

very much in development.
